      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
I’m Berezin Sergei, a Power Platform developer expanding into front-end development. I’m currently improving my HTML/CSS skills and Git workflow through RS School, focusing on semantic markup, layout, and clean project structure. My strengths are problem solving, clear communication, and turning requirements into working features. I’m easy-going, I love languages, and I enjoy traveling and learning new things. I’m inspired by automation and I want to build solutions that make people’s lives a little better, while growing into a junior front-end role or contributing to real projects that strengthen my UI skills.      </p>
